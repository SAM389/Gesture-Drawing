# Gesture-Drawing
Overview
Gesture Drawing Argumented Reality(AR) platform  With the help of hand gestures you can draw anything and explore your Creativity.

This project is about using openCV and media pipe libraries to utilize the web camera for drawing in real-time.
The main idea is:

-detect hands using mediapipe


-using hand-gesture to draw 


-use NumPy for data storage of hand coordinates 


-use cV2 to capture live video from the camera

MediaPipe Hands is a high-fidelity hand and finger tracking solution. It employs machine learning (ML) to infer 21 3D landmarks of a hand from just a single frame. Whereas current state-of-the-art approaches rely primarily on powerful desktop environments for inference, our method achieves real-time performance on a mobile phone and even scales to multiple hands. We hope that providing this hand perception functionality to the wider research and development community will result in an emergence of creative use cases, stimulating new applications and new research avenues.
